# @amykit/workflow-errand

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 98cc10e: **Breaking for workflow authors — one migration for two changes.**
  
  An action is declared once. `WorkflowRuntime.handlers()` and `Workflow.usesActions` are replaced by `WorkflowRuntime.actions`: a map whose keys are the actions the plan may emit and whose values run them — a handler, or `{ port, method }` for a method its port marked with the new `acceptsAction`, which the host calls with the action and its context and whose answer lands in `outcomes` under the action's name. The mount refuses at boot, by name, a key with nothing behind it, a port nothing mounted, a method the port lacks, or one that takes its own arguments rather than an action; the engine refuses a plan carrying an undeclared action before any of its actions run. A package still carrying `usesActions` or `handlers()` is refused with the sentence that says what to change.
  
  `apply` is told the move: `apply(record, plan, outcomes, observation, now, moved)`, where `moved` is `{ from, to }` for an advance and `null` otherwise. `record` has already moved, so where the work came from is `moved.from`, never `record.state`. `movedBy`, `runAction`, `implementationOf`, `undeclaredIn`, `unrunnable`, `mountedActions` and `mountedRuntime` are exported from the core.
  
  `ticket-to-qa` now resumes an answered escalation in the state that raised it — implementing, the gate, an automated or human fix, or reviewer assignment — instead of always in `HUMAN_FIX`, and starts its attempt counters again when it does. `@amykit/workflow-testkit` takes a `ports` option for actions declared as a port and a method, and `amy workflow new` scaffolds the new shape.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f1557f6: The worktree is the workplace.
  
  The core grows a `worktree` port (`acquire`, `pathFor`, `states`, `release`,
  `prune`) and the `acquire-worktree` action beside it. `Git` gains worktree
  mode without losing shared-checkout mode: with the port mounted, every path
  it answers — agent prompts, the gate, plan checks, commits and pushes — is
  the item's own tree, cut from the default branch, and preparing an item never
  repoints the standing checkout's branch. The new `@amykit/plugin-file-worktree`
  mounts the port over `~/.amy/worktrees/<workflow>/<workId>/<repo>`, prunes
  terminal clean trees after retention, logs every removal as
  `worktree.removed`, and refuses to delete an in-flight or dirty tree. The CLI
  gains `amy worktrees list|remove|prune`, and `amy doctor` reports both roots.

### Patch Changes

- c7a36eb: A base branch per repository.
  
  `baseBranch:` maps a repository to its own base branch beside `defaultBranch`,
  which keeps its name and stays the fallback; a config without the block
  resolves exactly as before. The map rides `pluginSlices` to every reader of
  the layout — the harnesses, the gate, the worktree manager, whose trees are
  cut from the mapped branch, and the workflows, which resolve the repository's
  own base where the piece of work is known — and the pull request each workflow
  opens is told that base by name, falling back to the forge's own default when
  nothing was named.
- b3b7a07: A checkout root per repository.
  
  `checkouts:` maps a repository to its own path beside `workspaceRoot`; a
  repository named there is never looked for under the root at all, `~` expands
  the way the root's does, and a config without the block resolves exactly as
  before. The map rides the host paths and every `Git` layout to the worktree
  manager, which cuts a named repository's trees from its own checkout, and
  `amy doctor` names which root it asked for each repository.
