# @amykit/workflow-testkit

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 7d2dd00: **A workflow is a Mermaid diagram.** A workflow's shape is the `workflow.mmd` beside it — an ordinary `stateDiagram-v2` that GitHub and Obsidian render — and the host reads its states, start, waits and ends from it when the workflow mounts; `defineWorkflow`'s `states`, `waiting` and `terminal` are required only without one, and declaring both is refused at boot. `readDiagram`, `connects`, `markState`, `withDiagramBeside` and the `notWritten()` stub are in the core, Mermaid-checked against Pele in its tests. The engine logs a move the diagram does not draw as `workflow.undrawn_transition` and makes it anyway; the testkit fails one, and with `everyEdge` an arrow no world walks. `amy workflow new --from <file.mmd>` turns a diagram into a workflow that mounts with every decision a stub, `amy workflow check` lists the stubs and the arrows not walked, and `amy workflow export [--work <id>]` prints the diagram with a record's state marked. `StateMachine` takes an optional `diagram`. The three shipped workflows are each drawn as one and lose their state lists and their exported unmounted `errand`, `noteToPlan`, `ticketToQa` and `newRecord`; bind a plugin with `withDiagramBeside(plugin, entry)` instead. `ticket-to-qa` no longer asks a reviewer again on every look when nothing was pushed since they requested changes.

### Minor Changes

- f9cdd5e: `@amykit/workflow-testkit` is new: `conforms(workflow, { runner, runtime, worlds })` registers the machine-shaped suite every workflow needs and nobody writes — every state reached and left, every planned action handled and surviving the call, no wait counted as a try, no decision made by `[].every(...)`, and no giving-up state without an honest way out — as ordinary tests in whichever runner it is handed, driven against worlds the author supplies. `amy workflow new` now writes that suite beside the scaffold as `index.test.js`, with `npm test` and the kit as a dev dependency, and the scaffold's `index.js` exports its `workflow` and a `runtime()` factory beside the plugin.
- 98cc10e: **Breaking for workflow authors — one migration for two changes.**
  
  An action is declared once. `WorkflowRuntime.handlers()` and `Workflow.usesActions` are replaced by `WorkflowRuntime.actions`: a map whose keys are the actions the plan may emit and whose values run them — a handler, or `{ port, method }` for a method its port marked with the new `acceptsAction`, which the host calls with the action and its context and whose answer lands in `outcomes` under the action's name. The mount refuses at boot, by name, a key with nothing behind it, a port nothing mounted, a method the port lacks, or one that takes its own arguments rather than an action; the engine refuses a plan carrying an undeclared action before any of its actions run. A package still carrying `usesActions` or `handlers()` is refused with the sentence that says what to change.
  
  `apply` is told the move: `apply(record, plan, outcomes, observation, now, moved)`, where `moved` is `{ from, to }` for an advance and `null` otherwise. `record` has already moved, so where the work came from is `moved.from`, never `record.state`. `movedBy`, `runAction`, `implementationOf`, `undeclaredIn`, `unrunnable`, `mountedActions` and `mountedRuntime` are exported from the core.
  
  `ticket-to-qa` now resumes an answered escalation in the state that raised it — implementing, the gate, an automated or human fix, or reviewer assignment — instead of always in `HUMAN_FIX`, and starts its attempt counters again when it does. `@amykit/workflow-testkit` takes a `ports` option for actions declared as a port and a method, and `amy workflow new` scaffolds the new shape.
