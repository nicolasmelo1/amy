**A run carries only what amy hands it.** The three agent CLIs amy drives used to carry the operator's own setup into a ticket run and write back into it. Now each run is kept apart:

- **Claude** runs with `--setting-sources project,local --strict-mcp-config --no-session-persistence`. The operator's `CLAUDE.md`, hooks, plugins, MCP servers and skills stay out, and no session or auto-memory is written under `~/.claude/projects`. The repository's own settings still load. A step whose skill ladder names a skill is lent that one skill through `--add-dir`, and nothing else of the operator's.
- **Codex** runs with `--ignore-user-config --ephemeral --disable hooks --disable plugins --disable apps --disable memories`. The login still comes from `CODEX_HOME`, and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and user skills still load, since Codex has no switch for them.
- **Hermes** runs in its own profile, `hermes -p amy`, set by the new `profile` setting. `amy init` and `amy add` create that profile from the active one when it is missing, with memory, unasked skill writes and the curator turned off. `amy doctor` goes red, naming the fix, when the profile is missing or has any of those turned back on.

**A plugin can prepare something outside amy's state.** `Plugin.setup` is run by `amy init` and `amy add` after a plugin's files. A setup gets the plugin's settings and a command runner, answers the way a check does, and one that throws is reported without stopping the next. `AskContext.skill` carries the skill a relay addressed the prompt to, with the directory it is installed in.
