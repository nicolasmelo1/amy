**A workflow is a Mermaid diagram.** A workflow's shape is the `workflow.mmd` beside it — an ordinary `stateDiagram-v2` that GitHub and Obsidian render — and the host reads its states, start, waits and ends from it when the workflow mounts; `defineWorkflow`'s `states`, `waiting` and `terminal` are required only without one, and declaring both is refused at boot. `readDiagram`, `connects`, `markState`, `withDiagramBeside` and the `notWritten()` stub are in the core, Mermaid-checked against Pele in its tests. The engine logs a move the diagram does not draw as `workflow.undrawn_transition` and makes it anyway; the testkit fails one, and with `everyEdge` an arrow no world walks. `amy workflow new --from <file.mmd>` turns a diagram into a workflow that mounts with every decision a stub, `amy workflow check` lists the stubs and the arrows not walked, and `amy workflow export [--work <id>]` prints the diagram with a record's state marked. `StateMachine` takes an optional `diagram`. The three shipped workflows are each drawn as one and lose their state lists and their exported unmounted `errand`, `noteToPlan`, `ticketToQa` and `newRecord`; bind a plugin with `withDiagramBeside(plugin, entry)` instead. `ticket-to-qa` no longer asks a reviewer again on every look when nothing was pushed since they requested changes.
