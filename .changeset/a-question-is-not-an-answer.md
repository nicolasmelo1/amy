**A reply in a work's thread can be a question, not only an answer.**

When `ticket-to-qa` escalated, or asked a question before starting, the owner's
first message in the thread ended the wait and the work resumed on it. A person
who replied "why do you think that comment is wrong?" had not decided anything,
and watched their question turn into work.

- `Reply` gains an optional `kind`, `discussion` or `decision`, set only when
  the person marked the reply. The catalogue gains `discuss`, on the `agent`
  port, so it is charged to the budget like every other run.
- `policy.conversation` on `ticket-to-qa`: `answer`, the default, reads a reply
  nobody marked as the decision, exactly as before. `discuss` reads it as a turn
  in a discussion: answered in the thread, read-only, with no state change, no
  commit and no attempt counted, while the work waits for a reply marked as the
  decision. A marked reply reads as marked under either. An unknown value is
  refused at boot by name.
- `AskContext` gains `readOnly`, and a discussion is asked with it. The
  harness enforces it rather than the prompt: Claude runs with
  `--permission-mode plan`, Codex with `--sandbox read-only`, and Hermes, whose
  one-shot mode cannot keep its tools off the checkout, refuses the run so a
  relay hands it to a harness that can.
- On the decision, the step the work resumes is prompted with the whole
  discussion, attributed, with the decision last.
- The Slack plugin marks a reply by the operator's own reaction on it: ✅
  (`white_check_mark`) decides, 💬 (`speech_balloon`) discusses. Both names are
  settings, `decisionReaction` and `discussionReaction`.
- Without a conversation port, a comment on the ticket is still the decision,
  whatever the policy says.
