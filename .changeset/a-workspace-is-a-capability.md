**A workspace is a capability.** Nothing is handed a workspace without asking: plugins borrow their checkouts through a `workspace` port the file-worktree plugin mounts, and workflows inherit them from their support, so a machine that works nowhere in particular needs none. The seven machine keys — `repos`, `workspaceRoot`, `checkouts`, `defaultBranch`, `baseBranch`, `gate` and `worktrees` — are read from the plugins whose slices carry them (`plugins: "@amykit/plugin-file-worktree"` for the six workspace keys, `plugins: "@amykit/plugin-command-gate"` for the gate). The doctor asks about checkouts, worktrees, `gh` and `git` only where a workspace was mounted, so a machine that drives no code — a support inbox, say — is told it is ready, and `amy update` moves an old install's keys under those slices, saying each move, keeping the original beside the config, and refusing a key put back at the top level by name. The provenance of every derived slice, now a property with its own falsifier (`machine_key_leaks_into_a_slice`).
