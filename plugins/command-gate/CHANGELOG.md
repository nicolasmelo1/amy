# @amykit/plugin-command-gate

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 75e1f57: **Breaking for anyone who implements or calls the agent, the gate or a ticket. It ships in the same release as the workflow contract change, so you migrate once.**
  
  The core's contracts carried one workflow's lifecycle into every workflow:
  - The agent port had `triage`, `implement` and `addressThreads`, each taking a `Ticket`.
  - The agent prepared branches, committed and pushed by itself.
  - The gate took a whole `Ticket` to find a directory.
  - `Ticket` required Linear's `branchName` and `team`.
  - The core prescribed a pull-request title.
  
  A workflow that pushed once per cycle had to replace the checkout to get that decision back.
  
  - **`Agent` is `ask(prompt, cwd, context)` and nothing else.** It lives in `ports/Agent.ts`, beside `AttemptOutcome` and `Progress`.
    - The catalogue keeps `triage`, `implement` and `address-threads` as action names, so ladders, skills and budgets keyed on them are unchanged. Each now dispatches to `agent.ask`.
    - Build a step on `ask`, or with the new `implementStep` and `judgeStep` from `@amykit/agent-kit`.
  - **`AskContext` gains an optional `verify`.** A relay calls it after each run that completed, so a step can turn a completed run that did not hold into `failed` while the ladder can still climb. `implementStep` commits there, so a rung that changed no file still hands the step to the stronger model or the next skill.
  - **`implementStep` commits only through a `commit` function its caller passes.** No agent touches git any more: `HarnessAgent`, `NamedAgent`, `AGENT_COLLECTION` and the `git` and `agent` options of `contributeTiers` are gone.
    - A harness plugin contributes its CLI to `HARNESS_COLLECTION` and nothing else.
    - The claude, codex and hermes-agent plugins no longer take `defaultBranch`, `baseBranch`, `checkouts` or `reviewerHints`.
  - **A `config.yaml` that set `defaultBranch`, `baseBranch`, `checkouts` or `reviewerHints` under `plugins:` for a harness is now refused at boot**, naming the key. Delete it. A harness is never told where the work lives, and `reviewerHints` belongs under `agent:`.
  - **`AgentRelay` is gone.** The relay mounts the `agent` port as `ask` over `HarnessRelay`, with the same skill and harness ladders, the same budget and the same boot refusals.
  - **`Gate.run` takes a `Workplace`**, which is `{ repo, workId }`. It lives in `ports/Gate.ts`. `CommandGate` runs in `pathFor(repo, workId)` as before.
  - **`Ticket.branchName` and `Ticket.team` are optional.** ticket-to-qa refuses a ticket without a `branchName` on its first look, naming the field.
  - **`pullRequestTitle`, `TriageOutcome` and `ThreadVerdict` moved to `@amykit/workflow-ticket-to-qa`**, which now owns its prompts:
    - prompts: `triagePrompt`, `implementPrompt`, `threadPrompt`;
    - readers: `readTriage`, `readVerdicts`;
    - helpers: `branchOf`, plus the `TicketGit` type for the part of `Git` it drives.
  - **`agent.reviewerHints` in `config.yaml` stays where it is.** It now reaches ticket-to-qa's review prompt instead of every harness plugin.
  
  Eight local rules in `.software-factory/rules/` hold these decisions, and `docs/design/an-agent-only-answers.md` records them.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f1557f6: The worktree is the workplace.
  
  The core grows a `worktree` port (`acquire`, `pathFor`, `states`, `release`,
  `prune`) and the `acquire-worktree` action beside it. `Git` gains worktree
  mode without losing shared-checkout mode: with the port mounted, every path
  it answers — agent prompts, the gate, plan checks, commits and pushes — is
  the item's own tree, cut from the default branch, and preparing an item never
  repoints the standing checkout's branch. The new `@amykit/plugin-file-worktree`
  mounts the port over `~/.amy/worktrees/<workflow>/<workId>/<repo>`, prunes
  terminal clean trees after retention, logs every removal as
  `worktree.removed`, and refuses to delete an in-flight or dirty tree. The CLI
  gains `amy worktrees list|remove|prune`, and `amy doctor` reports both roots.

### Patch Changes

- c7a36eb: A base branch per repository.
  
  `baseBranch:` maps a repository to its own base branch beside `defaultBranch`,
  which keeps its name and stays the fallback; a config without the block
  resolves exactly as before. The map rides `pluginSlices` to every reader of
  the layout — the harnesses, the gate, the worktree manager, whose trees are
  cut from the mapped branch, and the workflows, which resolve the repository's
  own base where the piece of work is known — and the pull request each workflow
  opens is told that base by name, falling back to the forge's own default when
  nothing was named.
- b3b7a07: A checkout root per repository.
  
  `checkouts:` maps a repository to its own path beside `workspaceRoot`; a
  repository named there is never looked for under the root at all, `~` expands
  the way the root's does, and a config without the block resolves exactly as
  before. The map rides the host paths and every `Git` layout to the worktree
  manager, which cuts a named repository's trees from its own checkout, and
  `amy doctor` names which root it asked for each repository.
- 5b37451: The ports belong to the core.
  
  `Tracker`, `Agent`, `Gate`, `Ticket` and the outcome contracts they carry
  moved from `@amykit/workflow-ticket-to-qa` to `@amykit/core`, beside
  `CodeHost` and `Harness`, so a workflow nobody shipped declares every port
  it needs by importing `@amykit/core` and no plugin in the install depends
  on a workflow package to know what a tracker is. The workflow re-exports
  every name for one minor version so nothing breaks on the way past, and
  the tracker contract grows a declared write surface: reads
  (`TrackerReads`) and writes (`TrackerWrites`) are separate interfaces a
  mount can hand out separately, with `TRACKER_WRITE_CAPABILITIES` naming
  what each core action resolves to.
