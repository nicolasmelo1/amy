# @amykit/plugin-serial-engine

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 5b37451: The ports belong to the core.
  
  `Tracker`, `Agent`, `Gate`, `Ticket` and the outcome contracts they carry
  moved from `@amykit/workflow-ticket-to-qa` to `@amykit/core`, beside
  `CodeHost` and `Harness`, so a workflow nobody shipped declares every port
  it needs by importing `@amykit/core` and no plugin in the install depends
  on a workflow package to know what a tracker is. The workflow re-exports
  every name for one minor version so nothing breaks on the way past, and
  the tracker contract grows a declared write surface: reads
  (`TrackerReads`) and writes (`TrackerWrites`) are separate interfaces a
  mount can hand out separately, with `TRACKER_WRITE_CAPABILITIES` naming
  what each core action resolves to.
