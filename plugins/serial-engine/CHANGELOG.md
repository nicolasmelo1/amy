## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 9bb3d24: Park an opted-in workflow before it spends another agent run with no new evidence.
- 98cc10e: **Breaking for workflow authors — one migration for two changes.**
  
  An action is declared once. `WorkflowRuntime.handlers()` and `Workflow.usesActions` are replaced by `WorkflowRuntime.actions`: a map whose keys are the actions the plan may emit and whose values run them — a handler, or `{ port, method }` for a method its port marked with the new `acceptsAction`, which the host calls with the action and its context and whose answer lands in `outcomes` under the action's name. The mount refuses at boot, by name, a key with nothing behind it, a port nothing mounted, a method the port lacks, or one that takes its own arguments rather than an action; the engine refuses a plan carrying an undeclared action before any of its actions run. A package still carrying `usesActions` or `handlers()` is refused with the sentence that says what to change.
  
  `apply` is told the move: `apply(record, plan, outcomes, observation, now, moved)`, where `moved` is `{ from, to }` for an advance and `null` otherwise. `record` has already moved, so where the work came from is `moved.from`, never `record.state`. `movedBy`, `runAction`, `implementationOf`, `undeclaredIn`, `unrunnable`, `mountedActions` and `mountedRuntime` are exported from the core.
  
  `ticket-to-qa` now resumes an answered escalation in the state that raised it — implementing, the gate, an automated or human fix, or reviewer assignment — instead of always in `HUMAN_FIX`, and starts its attempt counters again when it does. `@amykit/workflow-testkit` takes a `ports` option for actions declared as a port and a method, and `amy workflow new` scaffolds the new shape.

### Patch Changes

- f259468: A workflow now declares the code-host writes it may make, and the mount gives its runtime capability-limited tracker and code-host ports. `amy doctor` reports the selected workflow's external write surface, including tracker/code-host read-only installs.

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 5b37451: The ports belong to the core.
  
  `Tracker`, `Agent`, `Gate`, `Ticket` and the outcome contracts they carry
  moved from `@amykit/workflow-ticket-to-qa` to `@amykit/core`, beside
  `CodeHost` and `Harness`, so a workflow nobody shipped declares every port
  it needs by importing `@amykit/core` and no plugin in the install depends
  on a workflow package to know what a tracker is. The workflow re-exports
  every name for one minor version so nothing breaks on the way past, and
  the tracker contract grows a declared write surface: reads
  (`TrackerReads`) and writes (`TrackerWrites`) are separate interfaces a
  mount can hand out separately, with `TRACKER_WRITE_CAPABILITIES` naming
  what each core action resolves to.
