### Minor Changes

- b761f29: **A config is typed by its schema.** `definePlugin` gives a plugin's register and ready hooks the post-validation type derived from its schema, rejects mismatched defaults, and moves every shipped schema onto that declaration. Scalar and `string[]` settings no longer cast away the host's validation; record settings remain explicitly narrowed where a plugin needs a stronger value shape.
- 3649573: Plugin versions and unused workflow observer declarations were removed; package manifests supply displayed versions.
- f4069bb: **The config is written by what is mounted.** Every workflow's own
  vocabulary — the attempt ceilings its decisions read, the status a ticket
  moves to, where plans go and what judges them — moved out of the config's top
  level and into the profile that drives the workflow, checked at mount against
  the workflow's own `configSchema`. `amy init` writes a config that carries
  only the machine, and a commented example that teaches the shape;
  `amy add <workflow>` writes the profile block from what the workflow's schema
  asks for, with the settings that need an answer written as placeholders and
  the rest taken from defaults. `amy config explain` lists every setting the
  machine and each mounted thing carries, with its type, its default and the
  reason it is there; `amy config explain <plugin>` narrows to one.
  
  A key of the old shape left at the top level is refused at boot by name, with
  the place it moved to in the message, so nothing is silently read from where
  it lived. `amy update` moves a v1 config for you: each old key is rewritten
  under the profile or the plugin that reads it, the original file is kept
  beside the config as `config.yaml.moved`, and a second update changes
  nothing. The engine learns to tune itself at the same time — the serial
  engine's retry between failed items is its own setting now, no longer
  borrowed from whichever workflow's poll happened to be at the top of the
  config.
- 0ef3ae3: **The roster belongs to its workflow.** The team list that names who reviews
  and who owns QA is one ticket-to-qa profile's file, written by `init` and
  `add` beside the profile's records and confirmed by `amy roster confirm` —
  the workflow brought its command and its check with it, and none of the
  host's source names the file any more. Where a profile has no roster of its
  own, the workflow's red check names the file the machine kept where the
  roster used to live, so the error is a way back and not a dead end.
  
  `amy update` now gives an existing install its move: every team an older
  release kept at `~/.amy/roster.yaml` is copied into each profile that mounts
  the workflow, the old name is retired as `roster.yaml.moved` rather than
  deleted, and a second update changes nothing.
  
  The doctor asks the machine, and only the machine: a gate's commands are
  asked of the machines that mounted a gate, and each mounted plugin names the
  environment variables it reads — `plugin.environment` — so the errand's
  machine is green without the ticket workflow's tracker key, and no install
  carries a credential checklist nothing on it asked for. The quickstart walks
  the shape the machine has now: init, add a workflow, doctor, start.

### Patch Changes

- 344e3ab: **A brief is named the way its feature is.**
  
  A child ticket's `briefId` was its Linear parent's uuid, while the same parent
  read as a feature (`getFeature`, `features`) was named by its identifier, and
  the brief store keys a brief by that feature id. Every reader that asked the
  store for `ticket.briefId` — ticket-to-qa's brief lane, a workflow looking for
  a declaration file named `PROJ-1200.yaml` — found nothing, and read "no brief"
  rather than failing: a ticket under a groomed feature was driven as if nobody
  had groomed it. `briefId`, and `featureId` on updated groomed work, are now the
  parent's identifier, and a test holds a child and its feature to one name.
- 09cb74f: The docs describe the contract that exists. Every README is rewritten against the code: a plugin's README lists the ports, actions, operations, commands, events and environment its package registers, and opens with `amy.about`, a new field in its package.json saying when to use it.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e3cb22: What a private workflow had to write for itself, the shipped one now does.
  
  - A commit status GitHub returns in lower case reads as passing or failing; every one used to read as running.
  - `Git` commits without pushing, and `push` refuses anything that is not a fast-forward, naming the branch. `commitAndPush` is built on the two.
  - A review thread carries the file it is on.
  - The code host finds a pull request by the id in its title, open or merged, and the author's pull requests somebody asked to change. A workflow that claims no writes is handed `pullRequestAncestry` and both of these.
  - `ticket-to-qa` takes `policy.writes: operator`: every tracker and code-host write is said once, in the work's thread or through the notifier, and the machine waits until it sees it made. The workflow then claims no writes at all.
  - A ticket Linear labels into several repositories (`repoByLabel`) is one work item per repository, `TICKET@owner%2Fname`, and QA receives it once, when every one has merged.
  - `file-queue` takes `order: priority`: the most urgent due item first, first in first out within one priority, refreshed on every discovery from the tracker's own urgency.

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- 1641aed: A ticket or feature that is not in Linear answers `null` again instead of throwing. `issue(id:)` is non-null in Linear's schema, so a missing issue never came back as `null`: it came back as the error `Entity not found: Issue`, and `get` and `getFeature` threw it. That one error now reads as "gone"; every other error is still a failure.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c30789e: Add provider-neutral feature grooming with read-only base-branch snapshots and reconciliation provenance.

### Patch Changes

- 2dc9117: A brief reaches every ticket it explains.
  
  Tickets may inherit a shared brief from their Linear parent. The workflow reads
  that brief freshly on every observation, carries it to triage, implementation,
  review and its self-review half-step, records questions against it, and keeps a
  brief only while its explained work remains non-terminal or inside retention.
  `amy brief <id>` renders the mounted brief without exposing its store path.
- 64b4d24: The answer on the ticket reaches the agent, and the tracker stops carrying
  progress notices.
  
  `hasReplyAfter` could say *whether* a ticket was answered and never *what* was
  said, so `CLARIFYING` re-ran triage on an unchanged ticket, got the same
  questions back, and asked them again until it ran out of attempts — the one
  path built for "a human knows something the ticket does not" threw that
  knowledge away on arrival. The port gains `comments(ticketId, since?)`
  returning `{ author, body, at, fromAmy }`, with `fromAmy` settled by the
  tracker's own account of who wrote each comment; `hasReplyAfter` stays as the
  cheap boolean a waiting state polls with, and still fetches no text. An
  answered question now moves the work on: the state re-reads the ticket with
  the conversation attached, amy's own comments labelled as questions it already
  asked, and the second look never repeats a question the answer closed. The
  `triage` and `implement` prompts carry that conversation, attributed.
  
  `plugin-linear` also stops contributing its notification channel: a tracker
  comment is for a question that needs a person, and `failing`, `recovered` and
  `gave-up` are for the operator's channels. That removes the pollution —
  progress notices commented on a ticket under the operator's own name — rather
  than teaching every reader to filter it. `notify.tracker` is gone with it.
- fc6748a: The forge is asked, not run beside.
  
  Every gap in a port became an adapter in whoever hit it: a workflow that
  needed what the plugins know was shelling out to `gh` beside the plugin that
  already owned it and opening its own GraphQL connection to Linear beside the
  tracker that already had one, and the second workflow to hit the same gap
  wrote it all again. The port grows what the adapters were compensating for.
  
  `CodeHost` grows `pullRequest(repo, number)` — readable merged or not, the
  open-only filter staying where it belongs, in the by-branch search — and
  `PullRequestView` grows `merged` and `base`, mapped from the same node in
  the same query, with both reads running one shared fragment so they cannot
  drift apart. It grows `merge(repo, number, method)`, the method the base's
  ruleset allows being the caller's to name; `submitReview(repo, number,
  review)`, the state as forge vocabulary and the decision to submit as
  workflow policy; `createIssue(repo, { title, body })`; `commitStatuses(repo,
  sha)`, so a freeze is a workflow's reading of a status list rather than a
  private `gh api` of its own; and `changesRequestedOf(login, repos)`, the
  mirror of `reviewsRequestedOf` — "where did my review leave changes
  requested" — kept honest by the adapter reading each candidate by number,
  because the search cannot narrow on who left the changes requested.
  
  The tracker carries what a ticket is: `ISSUE_FIELDS` grows
  `labels { nodes { name } }` and `Ticket` grows `labels: string[]` — a label
  is how a team says what a ticket *is*, and with the description and the
  comments already shipped, the Linear reader a workflow carried has nothing
  left in it. What stays in the workflow is policy: which review state to
  submit, whose thread to close, what counts as a freeze.
- 5b37451: The ports belong to the core.
  
  `Tracker`, `Agent`, `Gate`, `Ticket` and the outcome contracts they carry
  moved from `@amykit/workflow-ticket-to-qa` to `@amykit/core`, beside
  `CodeHost` and `Harness`, so a workflow nobody shipped declares every port
  it needs by importing `@amykit/core` and no plugin in the install depends
  on a workflow package to know what a tracker is. The workflow re-exports
  every name for one minor version so nothing breaks on the way past, and
  the tracker contract grows a declared write surface: reads
  (`TrackerReads`) and writes (`TrackerWrites`) are separate interfaces a
  mount can hand out separately, with `TRACKER_WRITE_CAPABILITIES` naming
  what each core action resolves to.
- a499e82: The ticket's description reaches the agent's prompt, instead of an instruction
  to go and read a page it cannot open.
  
  `ISSUE_FIELDS` asked Linear for `id`, `identifier`, `title`, `url`,
  `branchName`, `state` and `team` — not `description` — so `Ticket` had no body
  and never could have one. `triage` and `implement` then built their prompts
  from the title and the tracker URL, and told the agent to "read the ticket":
  an instruction nothing under `claude -p` could obey, with no credential and no
  browser. The visible failure was an honest refusal; the expensive one was a
  ticket whose title sounded sufficient producing a full implementation that
  never saw the description's acceptance criteria, its named file, or the
  ownership boundary written in it — on an install where that duplicated an open
  pull request, 8 files and +615 lines on a 2-point ticket.
  
  Now the fetch asks for `description`, `toTicket` maps it to `body` (absent
  stays absent — an empty description is a real state, not an error), and the
  prompts carry the body where the work is judged by it. A ticket with no body
  says `(this ticket has no description)` rather than looking truncated, which is
  what lets the agent ask for one instead of inventing one. A tracker that
  supplies no body is unaffected: the field is optional and the prompt names the
  case it is in.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 4b54a6f: Stop commenting machine notices on the tracker, and stop counting cache reads
  against the token ceiling.
  
  Two defects that both made the machine lie to its operator, found on the same
  day on the same install.
  
  **`notify.tracker: false` was dead configuration.** `plugin-linear` contributed
  its notification channel unconditionally and never read the setting, so every
  engine notice was commented on the Linear ticket — under the operator's own
  name, because amy authenticates with a key issued to a person, and with no
  prefix or marker because the channel posted the raw announcement text. `PROJ-7716
  is moving again in DONE after 2 failed attempt(s)` reached a real ticket and a
  colleague replied to it asking what it meant. The channel is now contributed
  only when asked for, the default is off, and what it writes says a machine
  wrote it on the first line.
  
  **One agent run could park the machine for five hours.** The token ceiling
  summed `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite`. A single implement run
  reported `input: 44, output: 17394, cacheRead: 1839757, cacheWrite: 92769` —
  1,949,964 against a 2,000,000 per-five-hours ceiling, from a run that cost
  $0.91 against a $20 ceiling in the same window. A cache read is the saving,
  not the spend, so the better prompt caching worked the sooner the machine
  locked itself out. The ceiling now counts billable tokens; `costUsd` remains
  the ceiling that knows what cache is worth.
