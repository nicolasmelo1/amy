## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- b761f29: **A config is typed by its schema.** `definePlugin` gives a plugin's register and ready hooks the post-validation type derived from its schema, rejects mismatched defaults, and moves every shipped schema onto that declaration. Scalar and `string[]` settings no longer cast away the host's validation; record settings remain explicitly narrowed where a plugin needs a stronger value shape.
- 1ad01d3: **A command belongs to the package that means it.** A plugin declares
  `commands`, `checks` and `files` beside `register`, read after the module is
  imported and before anything mounts: `amy --help` lists `amy roster` beside
  the workflow that brought it, `amy doctor` runs the checks it brought, and
  `amy init`/`amy add` write the files it brought into the profile's state,
  once. A command that declares `mount: true` receives the mounted ports or a
  refusal naming why the machine did not come up; every other command answers on
  the machine that will not boot, which is when it matters.
  
  The host keeps the entry point and the ownership rules. A name belongs to one
  package, reusing a built-in or another package's command is refused at load
  naming both owners, and a command run against a profile that does not mount
  its owner names the profiles that do.
  
  `amy btw` moved to the errand, `amy note` to note-to-plan, `amy roster` to
  ticket-to-qa, `amy worktrees` to the worktree adapter and `amy models` to the
  relay; the CLI imports none of them. `pause` and `resume` became
  `amy stop --all` and `amy start`, `discover` became the first act of `amy
  tick` and is hidden rather than listed, `poke` became `look`, `workflow rm` merged into
  `amy remove <profile>` with `--keep-state`, the two `plugin add`/`plugin
  remove` verbs are gone, and `daemon`/`after-daemon` are hidden and still
  callable. A price table older than seven days is refreshed by `amy update`
  and `amy start` through the relay's own command, and a refresh that fails
  leaves the table as it was.
  
  Because `tick` now looks before it moves, two loops it exposed are closed: a
  note the machine wrote about its own failure is not itself planned, and
  discovery does not bring back work that reached its attempt ceiling: the
  record says `gaveUp`, and `amy look <id>` is the only thing that clears it.
  
  `HostPaths` gains `profile`, the directory a profile owns, so a workflow that
  keeps a file beside its records — the roster — reads what its own command
  writes. The roster moved there, which is why `amy init` no longer writes it on
  a machine that mounts nothing that assigns reviewers.
- 3649573: Plugin versions and unused workflow observer declarations were removed; package manifests supply displayed versions.
