# @amykit/plugin-plan-check

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- b761f29: **A config is typed by its schema.** `definePlugin` gives a plugin's register and ready hooks the post-validation type derived from its schema, rejects mismatched defaults, and moves every shipped schema onto that declaration. Scalar and `string[]` settings no longer cast away the host's validation; record settings remain explicitly narrowed where a plugin needs a stronger value shape.
- 3649573: Plugin versions and unused workflow observer declarations were removed; package manifests supply displayed versions.
- 2363da5: **The host lends the checkout.** `PluginContext` gains `checkouts()`, which answers with the `Git` and the layout for the calling plugin — the host's paths, the plugin's own `defaultBranch` and `baseBranch`, and the `worktree` port read whenever a path is asked for, so a worktree plugin listed after the caller is still the one used. The core exports `BRANCH_SETTINGS`, the two branch settings with one description, and every shipped schema that declares them spreads it in place of its own wording. The command gate, the plan check and the three workflows that opened pull requests ask their context instead of building a `Git` and a second copy of its layout. The settings stay per plugin, so no `config.yaml` changes; the plan check's `baseBranch` now defaults to `{}` like every other's.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f1557f6: The worktree is the workplace.
  
  The core grows a `worktree` port (`acquire`, `pathFor`, `states`, `release`,
  `prune`) and the `acquire-worktree` action beside it. `Git` gains worktree
  mode without losing shared-checkout mode: with the port mounted, every path
  it answers — agent prompts, the gate, plan checks, commits and pushes — is
  the item's own tree, cut from the default branch, and preparing an item never
  repoints the standing checkout's branch. The new `@amykit/plugin-file-worktree`
  mounts the port over `~/.amy/worktrees/<workflow>/<workId>/<repo>`, prunes
  terminal clean trees after retention, logs every removal as
  `worktree.removed`, and refuses to delete an in-flight or dirty tree. The CLI
  gains `amy worktrees list|remove|prune`, and `amy doctor` reports both roots.

### Patch Changes

- c7a36eb: A base branch per repository.
  
  `baseBranch:` maps a repository to its own base branch beside `defaultBranch`,
  which keeps its name and stays the fallback; a config without the block
  resolves exactly as before. The map rides `pluginSlices` to every reader of
  the layout — the harnesses, the gate, the worktree manager, whose trees are
  cut from the mapped branch, and the workflows, which resolve the repository's
  own base where the piece of work is known — and the pull request each workflow
  opens is told that base by name, falling back to the forge's own default when
  nothing was named.
- b3b7a07: A checkout root per repository.
  
  `checkouts:` maps a repository to its own path beside `workspaceRoot`; a
  repository named there is never looked for under the root at all, `~` expands
  the way the root's does, and a config without the block resolves exactly as
  before. The map rides the host paths and every `Git` layout to the worktree
  manager, which cuts a named repository's trees from its own checkout, and
  `amy doctor` names which root it asked for each repository.
