### Patch Changes

- f9944f6: A workflow is a name in a config, and a plugin is installed rather than
  compiled in.
  
  `--workflow` used to accept two literals, so an install could not drive a
  workflow this repository had not shipped — while the engine underneath it
  could drive anything. A profile is now an entry under `workflows:` in
  `.amy/config.yaml`: a name, the package that drives it, and optionally the
  plugins to mount under it. The two shipped ones are what a config with no
  such block gets.
  
  Each profile keeps its records and queue under `.amy/<name>/`, so a second
  workflow no longer writes over the first's state. **State from an older
  install stays where it was**: `amy doctor` names each directory it found and
  the one `mv` that moves it.
  
  The loader's table of literal imports is gone with the compiled binary. What
  installs is packages, resolved by name at run time, so a machine carries the
  plugins it uses and nothing else — `AMY_PACKAGES` takes the subset. A plugin
  named and not installed is refused at boot with the list of what is, and
  `amy plugin list` reports installed and mounted as the different questions
  they are.
  
  `@amykit/cli` therefore stops depending on ten plugins it never imported, and
  `amy init` prints the `npm install` line for whatever a configured workflow
  needs and this machine does not have.
