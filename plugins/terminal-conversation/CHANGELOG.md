# @amykit/plugin-terminal-conversation

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- a41a17f: **A shipped workflow runs as a phase.** A project walking BRIEF → WORK → PROVE on amy's own pieces stopped three times in 0.7.1, and the whole-project example hid all three. It never ran ticket-to-qa (it set the WORK child to `DONE` by hand), and it ran actions without the boot check the daemon makes.
  
  - **The unit a called record is for is the core's.** A called record's id is `SHOP-1/WORK#1`. ticket-to-qa asked the tracker for that id as a ticket, and its review lane did the same. errand and note-to-plan looked for a task and a note under it. prove, feature-grooming and the worktree plugin each kept a private split on `/`. `unitOf(record)` from `@amykit/core` now says what the unit is at any depth, keeping a root's `@repository`, and every one of them uses it. `L0.A_CALLED_RECORD_NAMES_ITS_UNIT` refuses a split of an id on `/` or `#` outside the core.
  - **The testkit walks every world called as a phase too.** `conformance` and `conforms` now walk each world a second time as `UNIT/PHASE#1`, under a new property, "called as a phase, it does what it does standing alone". The two walks must make the same tracker, code-host and conversation calls, plan the same actions and come to rest in the same state. A world that keeps state gives `again()` to be rebuilt, and `said()` with `watched()` to say what its ports were asked. A checkout or an agent's context may still key on the record's own id.
  - **A claude run that may write can write.** A print-mode run with no `--permission-mode` and the user's settings dropped is refused every edit, so a writing step answered and changed nothing. The new `permissionMode` setting (default `acceptEdits`; `auto` or `bypassPermissions` also allowed) is now always passed, and a read-only run is still `plan`. An empty, unknown or non-writing mode is refused at mount, naming the setting. `harnessConformance` in agent-kit holds claude and codex to it.
  - **A core action's name means the core's action.** prove's gave-up notice was a handler named `escalate`, the core's tracker write, so the mount counted a write prove never makes, for a tracker it does not need. It is now `give-up`. prove's own actions also reached no catalogue, so called as a phase it was refused ("action `lease`: nothing defines it"). A workflow's `catalogue` now declares its own actions on ports it needs, and the composed workflow carries every callee's to the mount. A handler under a core action's name, in a workflow that does not need that action's port, is refused at boot.
  - **A called phase is counted as it is standing alone.** A workflow's catalogue entry is now the port its handler reaches, so prove's agent step, now its own `run-agent-step` catalogued on `agent`, is counted by the budget through every call (it ran while the budget refused agent work), while a deterministic or `wait-until` step stays a `run-step` the budget does not hold; prove still boots with no agent mounted. A called workflow's `store` (by the name it asks for, whatever its call binds it to) lists its own records under every root rather than its caller's roots, so errand's `maxInFlight` and note-to-plan's `maxOpenPlansPerRepo` count errands and plans called as phases.
  - **A unit has one conversation, and reading it opens none.** `Conversation` gains a required `known(workId)`, which answers the thread a work already has and creates nothing. Slack, Telegram and the terminal implement it, and a conversation adapter of your own must too. ticket-to-qa reads replies through it, so a look that only reads leaves no thread behind. A called phase's threads are the unit's, titled by the ticket, setup's included. The notifier posts into the unit's thread too, instead of opening one under the call's id.

### Minor Changes

- 79a3fbd: **Setup is a workflow.**
  
  `amy init` wrote a template and left the person to it. `amy setup` asks, one
  question at a time, and is itself an amy workflow drawn in Mermaid: which
  harness should do the work (the ones detected on this machine offered first),
  which workflow it should drive, which channels should reach you — installing
  only what was chosen, asking each chosen plugin's settings one field at a
  time with the value the machine already holds offered as the default, and
  checking what it configured before it says it is done. `amy setup <plugin>`
  goes straight to configuring that one plugin. With no terminal to answer an
  ask, the walk stops on the question and prints the flag that answers it, so a
  pipeline can say it all at once. The old `amy init` is gone, alias included, and
  `amy setup <workflow>` writes the workflow's own files — the ticket workflow's
  roster — into the profiles that mount it. The terminal it asks in ships as
  `@amykit/plugin-terminal-conversation`, so the window can draw the same asks
  later with no change to the workflow.

### Patch Changes

- 09cb74f: The docs describe the contract that exists. Every README is rewritten against the code: a plugin's README lists the ports, actions, operations, commands, events and environment its package registers, and opens with `amy.about`, a new field in its package.json saying when to use it.
