### Minor Changes

- 7ec6c02: Nothing is installed by default: the command arrives alone, the first workflow is the one the person there names or writes.
  
  `@amykit/cli` depends on no workflow and no notifier. The roster the ticket workflow reads is contributed by the host under the name the workflow looks up — spelled where the file is read, not imported — and whether a Hermes target is reachable is asked of the `notify` port the mounted channel contributes.
  
  `SHIPPED_PROFILES` is empty: a config with no `workflows:` block drives nothing, and every command that needs one says so and names `amy workflow new` and `amy add`. `EXAMPLE_CONFIG` keeps the two published workflows as commented examples, its plugin slices commented with them, and `amy init` writes its files and installs nothing. A machine with nothing mounted is still diagnosed: `amy doctor` reports everything it can see and names the missing workflow in the selection's own words.
  
  New gate `bare-install`: the scenario installs the command alone onto a machine with none of it and proves what it can and cannot do — twelve assertions, from "the command arrives alone" to "doctor asks the port, not the package".
