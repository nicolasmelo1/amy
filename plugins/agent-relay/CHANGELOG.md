### Minor Changes

- 75e1f57: **Breaking for anyone who implements or calls the agent, the gate or a ticket. It ships in the same release as the workflow contract change, so you migrate once.**
  
  The core's contracts carried one workflow's lifecycle into every workflow:
  - The agent port had `triage`, `implement` and `addressThreads`, each taking a `Ticket`.
  - The agent prepared branches, committed and pushed by itself.
  - The gate took a whole `Ticket` to find a directory.
  - `Ticket` required Linear's `branchName` and `team`.
  - The core prescribed a pull-request title.
  
  A workflow that pushed once per cycle had to replace the checkout to get that decision back.
  
  - **`Agent` is `ask(prompt, cwd, context)` and nothing else.** It lives in `ports/Agent.ts`, beside `AttemptOutcome` and `Progress`.
    - The catalogue keeps `triage`, `implement` and `address-threads` as action names, so ladders, skills and budgets keyed on them are unchanged. Each now dispatches to `agent.ask`.
    - Build a step on `ask`, or with the new `implementStep` and `judgeStep` from `@amykit/agent-kit`.
  - **`AskContext` gains an optional `verify`.** A relay calls it after each run that completed, so a step can turn a completed run that did not hold into `failed` while the ladder can still climb. `implementStep` commits there, so a rung that changed no file still hands the step to the stronger model or the next skill.
  - **`implementStep` commits only through a `commit` function its caller passes.** No agent touches git any more: `HarnessAgent`, `NamedAgent`, `AGENT_COLLECTION` and the `git` and `agent` options of `contributeTiers` are gone.
    - A harness plugin contributes its CLI to `HARNESS_COLLECTION` and nothing else.
    - The claude, codex and hermes-agent plugins no longer take `defaultBranch`, `baseBranch`, `checkouts` or `reviewerHints`.
  - **A `config.yaml` that set `defaultBranch`, `baseBranch`, `checkouts` or `reviewerHints` under `plugins:` for a harness is now refused at boot**, naming the key. Delete it. A harness is never told where the work lives, and `reviewerHints` belongs under `agent:`.
  - **`AgentRelay` is gone.** The relay mounts the `agent` port as `ask` over `HarnessRelay`, with the same skill and harness ladders, the same budget and the same boot refusals.
  - **`Gate.run` takes a `Workplace`**, which is `{ repo, workId }`. It lives in `ports/Gate.ts`. `CommandGate` runs in `pathFor(repo, workId)` as before.
  - **`Ticket.branchName` and `Ticket.team` are optional.** ticket-to-qa refuses a ticket without a `branchName` on its first look, naming the field.
  - **`pullRequestTitle`, `TriageOutcome` and `ThreadVerdict` moved to `@amykit/workflow-ticket-to-qa`**, which now owns its prompts:
    - prompts: `triagePrompt`, `implementPrompt`, `threadPrompt`;
    - readers: `readTriage`, `readVerdicts`;
    - helpers: `branchOf`, plus the `TicketGit` type for the part of `Git` it drives.
  - **`agent.reviewerHints` in `config.yaml` stays where it is.** It now reaches ticket-to-qa's review prompt instead of every harness plugin.
  
  Eight local rules in `.software-factory/rules/` hold these decisions, and `docs/design/an-agent-only-answers.md` records them.

### Patch Changes

- 5b37451: The ports belong to the core.
  
  `Tracker`, `Agent`, `Gate`, `Ticket` and the outcome contracts they carry
  moved from `@amykit/workflow-ticket-to-qa` to `@amykit/core`, beside
  `CodeHost` and `Harness`, so a workflow nobody shipped declares every port
  it needs by importing `@amykit/core` and no plugin in the install depends
  on a workflow package to know what a tracker is. The workflow re-exports
  every name for one minor version so nothing breaks on the way past, and
  the tracker contract grows a declared write surface: reads
  (`TrackerReads`) and writes (`TrackerWrites`) are separate interfaces a
  mount can hand out separately, with `TRACKER_WRITE_CAPABILITIES` naming
  what each core action resolves to.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e603b3b: Refuse a dollar ceiling that cannot stop anything, and ask the harness rather
  than the price table.
  
  `specs.json` had no row for the Claude 5 family, so a run whose harness did not
  report a cost of its own was recorded with none, `spend.costUsd` never moved
  for it, and `amy budget` reported a figure that was arithmetically true and
  practically a lie. The table now prices `claude-opus-5`, `claude-sonnet-5`,
  `claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-sonnet-4-6` and `claude-fable-5-1`, declares the
  short names a harness CLI accepts (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `fable`) so a
  ladder written in them can be recognised, and adds `gpt-5.3-codex` and
  `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`. A refresh keeps the aliases and the long-context
  tiering, because models.dev carries neither.
  
  A price table always lags, so the lasting half is that the ceiling knows: a
  `costUsd` ceiling is refused at boot when a rung in any ladder — including a
  step's own — names a model whose cost nobody could work out, naming the model
  and the rung.
  
  **Whose cost nobody could work out is not the same question as whose model is
  in the table**, and conflating the two is the reason this is one change rather
  than two. A rung now declares whether its harness accounts for itself
  (`Rung.pricesItsOwnRuns`), and only a rung that does not is measured against
  the table:
  
  - **claude** puts `total_cost_usd` in its envelope, and a cost the harness
    reported beats anything a table computes.
  - **hermes** writes `cost_status: "included"` for a run a subscription or a
    local model covered — where zero is the right answer rather than a missing
    one, and no price list will ever publish a rate for a model running on
    somebody's own machine — and prices the rest of its providers itself.
  - **codex** reports no cost of its own, so the vendored table is the only way
    one of its runs gets a price. It is the one harness a missing row leaves a
    dollar ceiling inert for.
  
  Reading the table's answer as the whole question would refuse an install whose
  ceiling works perfectly well, which is the same failure as an inert ceiling
  reached from the other side: a machine that will not start over a number it
  already has.
  
  The refusal also no longer offers a command that could not fix it.
  `amy models refresh` re-rates the models the table already has and never adds
  one, so a model with no row at all is told to get one in
  `.amy/model-specs.json`, or a ceiling in tokens. `amy budget` says the same.
  
  **Breaking for one config shape:** `ladder: [codex]` — a codex install naming
  no model — is now refused under a `costUsd` ceiling, because there is no id to
  price it by and codex reports nothing to price it with. Name the model
  (`codex:gpt-5`) or set the ceiling in tokens.
- a0ec22e: The settings `amy init` writes assemble into a machine that boots — and the
  check that says so runs from the gate, not from a memory of a real install.
  
  `EXAMPLE_CONFIG` shipped `claude:opus` in the default ladder and again in a
  step's own. `everyLadderEntry` unions the default ladder with every per-step
  one and does not dedupe, so `tiersFor` produced `["sonnet", "opus", "haiku",
  "opus"]`, `contributeTiers` contributed a second agent named `claude:opus`, and
  the second one met the collection's one-name rule at mount. `amy init` wrote a
  config its own first `amy doctor` refused, and the workaround — deleting the
  per-step ladder the template exists to teach — configured the feature out of
  an install because of a missing `Set`.
  
  The union dedupes in one place, `contributeTiers`, preserving first-seen
  order: a ladder is ordered and the first mention is the one that means
  something.
  
  And the template check grows the claim it was always about: `npm run
  check:config` now assembles the settings the template ships — the same `load`,
  the same `pluginList`, the same `mount` a real boot runs — and refuses a
  template whose machine does not start.
  
  Nothing being installed by default, the template's `workflows:` block is a
  commented example, so the check mounts the settings under the workflow that
  example names: the machine the operator has one uncomment later. That is where
  the ladder, the budget, the gate and the skills actually meet a `mount`, and
  where the duplicate rung hid. The transcription is the one thing that can go
  stale, so a template that stops offering the example it copied turns the check
  red rather than leaving it mounting something nobody is offered.
  
  The unit tests prove every direction: the shipped example mounts, the check
  leaves the environment as it found it, and a template whose budget window
  nothing meters, whose ladder names a harness nothing contributes, or which
  renames the example out from under the transcription, turns the check red.
  
  The relay's gate carries the proof: `relay.a_rung_named_twice_mounts_once`
  mounts the template's own ladder shape against the built plugins, and
  `relay.the_first_mention_sets_the_order` walks a step onto the rung its
  step's ladder names first.
