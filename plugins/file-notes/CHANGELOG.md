# @amykit/plugin-file-notes

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- b761f29: **A config is typed by its schema.** `definePlugin` gives a plugin's register and ready hooks the post-validation type derived from its schema, rejects mismatched defaults, and moves every shipped schema onto that declaration. Scalar and `string[]` settings no longer cast away the host's validation; record settings remain explicitly narrowed where a plugin needs a stronger value shape.
- 1ad01d3: **A command belongs to the package that means it.** A plugin declares
  `commands`, `checks` and `files` beside `register`, read after the module is
  imported and before anything mounts: `amy --help` lists `amy roster` beside
  the workflow that brought it, `amy doctor` runs the checks it brought, and
  `amy init`/`amy add` write the files it brought into the profile's state,
  once. A command that declares `mount: true` receives the mounted ports or a
  refusal naming why the machine did not come up; every other command answers on
  the machine that will not boot, which is when it matters.
  
  The host keeps the entry point and the ownership rules. A name belongs to one
  package, reusing a built-in or another package's command is refused at load
  naming both owners, and a command run against a profile that does not mount
  its owner names the profiles that do.
  
  `amy btw` moved to the errand, `amy note` to note-to-plan, `amy roster` to
  ticket-to-qa, `amy worktrees` to the worktree adapter and `amy models` to the
  relay; the CLI imports none of them. `pause` and `resume` became
  `amy stop --all` and `amy start`, `discover` became the first act of `amy
  tick` and is hidden rather than listed, `poke` became `look`, `workflow rm` merged into
  `amy remove <profile>` with `--keep-state`, the two `plugin add`/`plugin
  remove` verbs are gone, and `daemon`/`after-daemon` are hidden and still
  callable. A price table older than seven days is refreshed by `amy update`
  and `amy start` through the relay's own command, and a refresh that fails
  leaves the table as it was.
  
  Because `tick` now looks before it moves, two loops it exposed are closed: a
  note the machine wrote about its own failure is not itself planned, and
  discovery does not bring back work that reached its attempt ceiling: the
  record says `gaveUp`, and `amy look <id>` is the only thing that clears it.
  
  `HostPaths` gains `profile`, the directory a profile owns, so a workflow that
  keeps a file beside its records — the roster — reads what its own command
  writes. The roster moved there, which is why `amy init` no longer writes it on
  a machine that mounts nothing that assigns reviewers.
- 3649573: Plugin versions and unused workflow observer declarations were removed; package manifests supply displayed versions.

### Patch Changes

- d551e5b: amy is one install per machine, and it stays running.
  
  **State moved to `~/.amy`.** It used to live in `./.amy`, so `amy status`
  answered differently depending on where you were standing — and the wrong
  answer was "nothing tracked yet". amy drives work in checkouts all over the
  disk and is reached from whichever harness you are in, so it cannot be
  per-directory. `AMY_HOME` overrides. **State left in a working directory is
  reported by `amy doctor` and never adopted**, because picking it up silently
  would restore the behaviour being removed.
  
  **`amy start` and `amy stop` are the loop.** `start` runs it in the background
  with `--every <seconds>`, outliving the terminal that started it; `stop` ends
  it. `amy status` says whether it is up and since when.
  
  **`amy pause` and `amy resume` are the handbrake**, which is what `stop` and
  `start` used to be. Pausing ends work in flight and starts nothing new while
  the loop stays up. It survives a reboot because it is a file; the loop does
  not, because it is a process.
  
  **`amy workflow list` and `amy workflow rm`.** `rm` deletes a profile's
  records, its queue and its config entry, and prints what it would do unless
  given `--yes`. It never touches the log, which is append-only because the
  budget is measured off it.
  
  **`amy skills`** installs amy's skills into every harness it finds — Claude
  Code and Hermes today — rather than into one project. They ship inside
  `@amykit/cli` so they cannot drift from the amy that ships them. Three new ones:
  `/amy-init`, `/amy-show-me`, `/amy-status`, and `/amy-workflow` is now an
  interrogation that redraws the workflow after every answer.
  
  Changing amy's own codebase is not one of them: that is what `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  is for. A skill describing a repository the reader does not have is noise in
  the list an agent reads when deciding what to reach for.
  
  **`amy status --json`** for something else to render.
  
  Fixed: a hand-written plugin slice replaced the derived one instead of merging
  with it, so a config that set `retentionDays` on the queue lost the
  `directory` beside it — and two profiles quietly shared one queue, each
  claiming the other's work.
  
  `specTable()` now takes the state directory rather than a working directory,
  and `OVERRIDE_PATH` becomes `OVERRIDE_FILE`.
- f9944f6: A workflow is a name in a config, and a plugin is installed rather than
  compiled in.
  
  `--workflow` used to accept two literals, so an install could not drive a
  workflow this repository had not shipped — while the engine underneath it
  could drive anything. A profile is now an entry under `workflows:` in
  `.amy/config.yaml`: a name, the package that drives it, and optionally the
  plugins to mount under it. The two shipped ones are what a config with no
  such block gets.
  
  Each profile keeps its records and queue under `.amy/<name>/`, so a second
  workflow no longer writes over the first's state. **State from an older
  install stays where it was**: `amy doctor` names each directory it found and
  the one `mv` that moves it.
  
  The loader's table of literal imports is gone with the compiled binary. What
  installs is packages, resolved by name at run time, so a machine carries the
  plugins it uses and nothing else — `AMY_PACKAGES` takes the subset. A plugin
  named and not installed is refused at boot with the list of what is, and
  `amy plugin list` reports installed and mounted as the different questions
  they are.
  
  `@amykit/cli` therefore stops depending on ten plugins it never imported, and
  `amy init` prints the `npm install` line for whatever a configured workflow
  needs and this machine does not have.
